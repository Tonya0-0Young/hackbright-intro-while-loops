Greetings!

I was at a board meeting for Amazon.com, and all of the board members were raving about your ability to program robots. I hope you don’t mind that they gave me your contact information.

I have been trying to get my new company, TGM, Inc. off the ground for some time now. However, it seems as though we don’t have enough games to sell, so we don’t have the traction we want. 

Based on the outstanding things we’ve heard about you, we would like to offer you some compensation to make a terminal-based game. 

Our marketing department thinks that having Rock-Paper-Scissor would complete our basic games offering, so could you program that for us?

I know it’s a big task, but I have confidence that you can break it up into manageable pieces.

Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Thanks again,
Xavier Savier
CEO, Terminal Games Marketplace, Inc.

PS.  The best way to get your completed game to me is create a file in this directory in your clone of your fork of this repository, and to push it back to your fork when you are done.
