## Part 2: For Loops
### Fork and Clone

Before starting on the exercise, fork and clone this repo.

### Get started

*Do the following exercises in a file called `while_fun_loops.py` in the `01-while-loops` folder inside the local clone of your fork of this repository.*

**Remember to commit early and often!**

1. Using a `while` loop, print out the numbers from 1 to 20.
1. Using a `while` loop, print out the numbers from 1 to 20, but if the number is 13, print the word `"hello"` instead of the number.
1. Using a `while` loop, print out the numbers from 0 to 100 (including the number 100) in increments of 10. (e.g. 0, 10, 20, 30, … , 100)
1. Using a `while` loop, print out the odd numbers from 0 to 10.
1. Using a `while` loop, print out the numbers from 10 to 0 (including 0).
  1. Modify this for loop to print out `"Blastoff!"` instead of printing 0.
1. Create a list called fruits that contains `"apples"`, `"oranges"`, and `"bananas"`
  1. Using a `while` loop, go through the list, and print out each fruit.
1. Create a function called `sum_nums` that takes in a number called `num`. `sum_nums` should use a `while` loop to add up all of the numbers from 0 until (but not including) `num`. `sum_nums` should return this sum.<br>
  **Example**: `print sum_nums(3)` ⇒ `3`
  1. Modify `sum_nums` to add up all the numbers from 0 to `num`, including `num`.<br>
  **Example**: `print sum_nums(3)`	⇒	  `6`
  1. Write a function called `sum_nums2` that takes one parameter.  If the parameter is negative, `sum_nums2` should add up all of the numbers from 0 to the negative number and return that sum. If the parameter `num` is positive, `sum_nums2` should work the same as `sum_nums` above.<br>
  **Example**: `print sum_nums2(-3)` 	⇒ `-6` 
1. Write a function called `fizz_buzz` that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print `"Fizz"` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `"Buzz"`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `"FizzBuzz"`.

*Remember to push your changes when you're done! (Hopefully you've already been committing after each exercise!)*
